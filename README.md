Create a text file containing a story, with "blanks" (actually, terms in brackets) to be filled in. Here is an example, "The Best Day of My Whole Life," from the Wacky Web Tales site mentioned above. I chose this one because it has relatively few blanks to fill in.
One day I was walking to school when I found a wallet
on the ground. I picked it up. It had no ID in it, so
I decided to keep it. It had [large number] bucks in it.
Like any kid, I was [adjective].
The first thing I did was go to the police to check if
anybody lost it. The man said he would keep it in case.
I was, of course, [feeling]. Then after a few days of
being happy, I got a call from the person who lost the
wallet. He said he was really [feeling] with me for being
honest. He was so grateful that he sent my family and me
on a trip to [foreign country].
It was the most [adjective] day of my life!
Save your (original) story on a text file (.txt), not a formatted file such as MSWord produces. Name your file story.txt. Try to make it amusing!
Your program should read this file, one line at a time, into an ArrayList. Then it should search each line in the ArrayList for any text within brackets, ask the user for a word or words of that kind (don't show the brackets), and replace them in the text. For each question, use "a" before a consonant, "an" before a vowel; for example, if you are asking for an adjective, ask for an adjective, not for a adjective. Consider a-e-i-o-u (uppercase or lowercase) to be vowels, but not y.
Fill in the blanks to get an exciting story!
Enter a large number: (User types something in for each of these)
Enter an adjective:
Enter a feeling:
Enter a feeling:
Enter a foreign country:
Enter an adjective:
When everything has been filled in, print the story.
